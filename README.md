## predoc.org web scrapping

### Introduction

This Python script automates the task of scraping RA (Research Assistant) opportunities from the [predoc.org](https://predoc.org) website. It generates an Excel file with two sheets: one for "predoc.opportunities" and the other for "predoc.ra-opportunities." The dataset automatically filters out opportunities with application deadlines that have already passed based on today's date.

### Packages
   Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can install them using pip:
   This code needs pandas, numpy, BeautifulSoup, requests, and datetime

###  Important Notes
- Make sure to check the [predoc.org](https://predoc.org) website regularly as the script is designed to work based on certain assumptions:
- The website follows a consistent format: the text and hyperlinks for opportunities should be in a specific format for the script to capture them.
- The script filters out opportunities with application deadlines that have already passed to provide you with up-to-date information.

### Good Luck!
Feel free to customize and enhance this script to meet your specific needs. Happy scraping!
Also, if you find an error, please let me know too.
